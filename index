Just starting off in the industry, I am interested in working on layout and illustrations (such as posters and logo design). I am open to exploring and working on new, different areas of design, adding my own flair to everything I help create and connecting to others in, and outside, the industry. </p>

Texture was a big part of the creation of the typography, the word 'Forest' being made of woods, and 'Dweller' being made of stone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

A tea brand was what came to mind for me, where i incorporated the imagery of green tea leaves themselves, and gnomes, to add a touch of fantasy to the branding, as well as the actual well itself.</p>

I came up wih a TV show centered around folk mythology, such as myths of the Sasquatch, gnomes, among others. I gave the whole canvas a texture to add to the sense of tension and mystery of looking for creatures that are mysterious in the eyes of the viewer of the poster AND the show. </p>
